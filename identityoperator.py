x = 10
y = 20

print(x is y) # x is y means x aur y ki value same hai as like x==y 

print(x is not y) # x is not y means x aur y ki value alag alag hai as like x!= y


# identity operator mai " is and is not " ka used hota hai

# note: x==y and x!=y are as same as x is y and x is not y both are same to aap kuch bhi use kar sakte ho...
